Outline of the week

- STSM stuff
- Reading bibliography on molecular dynamics and active matter
- wrapping up the width and depth analysis on the grooved system (i had two problems here, the way i set up the initial conditions wasn't generalized enough and I hadn't considered that the change in the topography of the substrate would also influence the regime of validity of the the model, well, it does)

Today:
- reading up on LAMMPS
